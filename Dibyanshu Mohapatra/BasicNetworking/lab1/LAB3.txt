 Test Local Connection

Before attempting to connect from another computer, test the installation locally.

1. Open a Command Prompt and run this command to subscribe to a topic called `test_topic`:
       
    `mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test_topic`
    
2. Open another Command Prompt and run this command to publish a message to `test_topic`:
    
      `mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test_topic -m "Hello, World!"`
    
3. If everything is set up correctly, the message "Hello, World!" should appear in the window where `mosquitto_sub` is running.
